# The Nerd Project

**Hello and welcome!** ...to "The Nerd Project"!<br>
"Nerd" is supposed to be a...<br>
*'game engine'*, (...uhh, yes...?) that aims to wrap the "Processing" creative-coding framework's APIs to make it easier to use it for large projects.

...By the way,

## *This is a rewrite!*

...well, really, it just *was*.<br>
...For the *third* time in my life.<br>
What it really was, was a refactor of code added over `532` \[*existing*\] commits.

There's stuff in [the other branch](https://github.com/Brahvim/TheNerdProject/tree/master), which is where the code accumulated through the previous one-and-half-a-year - the *second* rewrite ever, resides! It shows what features Nerd already has; there's also example code and Javadoc comments, so, feel free to go check it out!<br>
The initial version that I wrote 2 years ago or so can be found in another repository [here](https://github.com/Brahvim/GameEngine).<br>
For more history on how I got inspiration, see this other repository [here](https://github.com/Brahvim/Scene-Layer-API).

<p>
Feel free to remind me about integrating a visual editor into it the day I'm done with this!<br>
You may want to *go look at the history,* this project actually has been very big in the past!

PS Have a look at [extra `NerdModule`s](https://github.com/Brahvim/NerdExtraModules)!<br>
You'll find in there, Nerd's ECS and other parts of the framework that are not central.<br>
Wish me luck if you'd like. Enjoy watching me build this thing that would be in your hands someday!

Thanks :),<br>
