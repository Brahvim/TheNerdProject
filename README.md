# The Nerd Project
**Hello!** And welcome, to "The Nerd Project"! This project aims at wrapping the "Processing" creative-coding framework
(and some of its libraries) to make it easier to work with the framework for large projects.

*Really,* nobody spots this little corner of the internet by which I (Brahvim) reside, so I guess it's something only I 
am [making, and...] using (not yet, actually!). Open-sourcing and giving freedom is pretty cool too!
I'd love to see your modifications, if you seem to be able to make any! :grin:
...that's why it even *is* here, I suppose!

Together, we *might* create a ***fantastic*** wrapper for Processing, which will help people create!

Nerd seems to be well-built for video games, but it's totally usable for awesome animations, too!

# The API
Nerd works through `Scene`s and `Layer`s.
