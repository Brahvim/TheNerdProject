# The Nerd Project

**Hello and welcome!** ...to "The Nerd Project"!<br>
<br>
"Nerd" is supposed to be a *'game engine'*, (...uhh, yes...?) that aims to wrap the "Processing" creative-coding framework's APIs to make it easier to use it for large projects.

By the way, I've been rewriting it. on top of `532` existing commits. ...For the fourth time in my life!<br>
<br>
There's stuff in [the other branch](https://github.com/Brahvim/TheNerdProject/tree/master), which is where the code accumulated through the previous one-and-half-a-year - the *second* rewrite ever, resides! It shows what features Nerd already has; there's also example code and Javadoc comments, so, feel free to go check it out!<br>
<br>
The initial version that I wrote 2 years ago or so can be found in another repository [here](https://github.com/Brahvim/GameEngine).
For more history on where I got inspiration, see this other repository [here](https://github.com/Brahvim/Scene-Layer-API).

Feel free to remind me about integrating a visual editor into it the day I'm done with this!<br>
*Go look at the history,* this project actually has been big in the past!

PS Have a look at [extra `NerdModule`s](https://github.com/Brahvim/NerdExtraModules)!<br>
You'll find in there, Nerd's ECS and other parts of the framework that are not central.

Wish me luck if you'd like, and enjoy watching me build this thing that could be in your hands *someday!*

Thanks :),<br>
