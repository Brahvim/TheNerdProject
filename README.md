# The Nerd Project

**Hello and welcome!** ...to "The Nerd Project"!<br>
<br>
"Nerd" is supposed to be a *'game engine'*, (...uhh, yes...?) that aims to wrap the "Processing" creative-coding framework's APIs to make it easier to use it for large projects.

By the way, I've been rewiting it. For the fourth time in my life!<br>
There's stuff in [the other branch](https://github.com/Brahvim/TheNerdProject/tree/master), which is where the code accumulated through the previous one-and-a-half year - the second rewrite, resides!<br>
The initial version that I wrote 2 years ago or so can be found in another repository [here](https://github.com/Brahvim/GameEngine).
For more history on where I got inspiration, see this other repository [here](https://github.com/Brahvim/Scene-Layer-API).

Feel free to remind me about integrating a visual editor into it the day I'm done with this!<br>
*Go look at the history,* this project actually has been big in the past!

Wish me luck if you'd like, and enjoy watching me build this thing that could be in your hands *someday!*

Thanks :),<br>
\- Brahvim.
