### The latest of my decisions...

Introducing... "scene templates"! All they do, is inject fields into the class they annotate to add fields that are specified - the type of each of which is `NerdModule`.

Introducing... "renderer-specific subclasses"! ...They'll *hopefully* make `PGraphics` and `PApplet` feel less clunky.

Studied up on the use of compile-time annotation processing for scene templates, but gave up because of IDE support for the Java Compiler API and annotations...? Maybe I **AM** not learning correctly! This leads us back to the decision of sticking with inheritance.

So, to get `NerdModule`s, API users will now need to extend `NerdScene` and add the stuff themselves. No annotation magic <:(!...

The rest is just... borrowing and refactoring code from the previous rewrite.  
At least it all runs!
